- Did tests in a uniax with no oxygen present to steel shaved off end platens didn't burn. Also shielded end platens
- Monopole, coil, and microwave horn antennas
- Used photodiode to monitor light emission
- Made 0.6cm thick steel chamber to put antenna and sample in so no electrical signal from the press interfered.
- Some energy was dust particles colliding from sample breaking.  This turbulent factor was removed by wrapping the sample in electrical tape and observing less of that signature.
- Believe light is produced by exoelectrons bombarding surrounding fluid, not the fracture.  (same for charged surfaces)}

- Generation of a conductor to bring charge to the surface, steam is the insulator
- Charging is accomplished by vaporizing the water

- Sufficient heat is needed to vaporize water, but pore pressure has to stay low.  Central conductor depends on shear zone width, stress displacement and sliding velocity.
- Larger stress drop earthquakes would have higher slip velocities meaning larger electromagnetic phenomena.  Case of 1975 Haicheng EQ
